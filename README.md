# Web Scraping with Beautiful Soap 4 for Python

<img src='https://github.com/PabloRR100/Betcomm/blob/master/Scrapping/images/title.png?raw=true' style='width:50%'>

In this repo I have wrote some scripts to perform Web Scrapping to obtain information about the [Spanish Footbal Leage](https://www.laliga.es). I like to bet and compete with my friends on forecasting football results. This tool is helpfull to make an Excel file instantaneously, so you can keep track of your progress.  


I have done a [demo]() to show and explain line by line how to implemenent it with a easy example:  
Retrieving the [calendar with all the matches of the 2018-2019 season]()

The rest of the files are just the code that can be run to obtain:  

- [Teams and Players](https://github.com/PabloRR100/web_scrapping/blob/master/1_web_scrapper_teams_and_players.py)
- [Calendar from 2010 to 2017](https://github.com/PabloRR100/web_scrapping/blob/master/0_web_scrapper_2010_2017.py)
- [All statistics from matches](https://github.com/PabloRR100/web_scrapping/blob/master/2_web_scrapper_match_details.py)
