In this repo I have wrote some scripts to perform Web Scrapping to obtain information about the <a href="https://www.laliga.es" target="_blank"> Spanish Footbal Leage </a>. I like to bet and compete with my friends on forecasting football results. This tool is helpfull to make an Excel file instantaneously, so you can keep track of your progress.  


I have done a <a href="https://github.com/PabloRR100/web_scrapping/blob/master/Calendar.md" target="_blank"> Tutorial </a> to show and explain line by line how to implemenent it with a easy example:  
Retrieving the <a href="https://github.com/PabloRR100/web_scrapping/blob/master/Calendar.md" target="_blank"> calendar with all the matches of the 2018-2019 season </a>


The rest of the files are just the code that can be run to obtain:  

- <a href = 'https://github.com/PabloRR100/web_scrapping/blob/master/1_web_scrapper_teams_and_players.py' target = '_blank'> Teams and Players </a>
- <a href = 'https://github.com/PabloRR100/web_scrapping/blob/master/0_web_scrapper_2010_2017.py' target = '_blank'> Calendar from 2010 to 2017 </a>
- <a href = 'https://github.com/PabloRR100/web_scrapping/blob/master/2_web_scrapper_match_details.py' target = '_blank'> All statistics from matches </a>
